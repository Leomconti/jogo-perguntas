# Hey guys, this is the best project!

Welcome to our awesome project! This repository contains both the frontend and backend components of our application. Here's a brief overview of the technologies used in each part:

## Frontend (front)

Our frontend is built using modern web technologies to provide a smooth and interactive user experience:

- Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- Tanstack Query: A powerful data fetching and state management library for React applications.
- Zod: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

## Backend (back)

Our backend is powered by a robust set of technologies to handle server-side logic and data management:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- TypeScript: Used for adding static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- Drizzle ORM: A lightweight and performant TypeScript ORM for SQL databases.
- PostgreSQL: An advanced open-source relational database.
- Passport: Authentication middleware for Node.js.
- Zod: Used for schema validation on the server-side as well.
- Winston: A versatile logging library for Node.js.

Both the frontend and backend use various other libraries and tools to enhance development experience and application functionality. Check out the respective `package.json` files for a complete list of dependencies.
